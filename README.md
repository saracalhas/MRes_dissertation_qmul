### Background
Dementia is a serious global health challenge. Modifiable risk factors and emerging disease-modifying treatments underscore the importance of early diagnosis. Dementia diagnosis is complex and typically occurs only when symptoms emerge, which may be too late as significant brain damage may have already occurred. The increasing availability of multimodal data and powerful machine learning algorithms opens new avenues for detecting individualised dementia risk in the preclinical stage. This research aims to identify cost-effective, non-invasive dementia risk signatures, such as blood-based biomarkers for dementia risk prediction. To the best of the authorâ€™s knowledge, this is the first study to integrate proteomics, metabolomics, genetic markers, and baseline clinical variables for individualised dementia risk prediction in the preclinical stage. Results from this work will determine whether blood-based biomarkers and machine learning can predict future dementia risk at an individual level.
