# Code used in this project
### Background
This repo is the companion of the MRes dissertation with the title: **Individualised risk prediction for dementia, deriving actionable information from multimodal data**. This research aims to identify cost-effective, non-invasive dementia risk signatures, such as blood-based biomarkers for dementia risk prediction. To the best of the authorâ€™s knowledge, this is the first study combining advances in machine learning and integrating proteomics, metabolomics, genetic markers, and baseline clinical variables for individualised dementia risk prediction in the preclinical stage. Results from this work will help determine whether blood-based biomarkers and machine learning can predict future dementia risk at an individual level. 

All the code used for this MRes project is available in this repo. Below more information on how it is organised.

### Code in this repo
- **Data pre-processing and descriptive statistics folder** (Name of folder: Data_pre_process_and_descriptive_stats). This reflects work done in sections 5.1 and part of 5.2.
  
    - File name: Data_pre_process_and_statsanalysis.ipynb, also available as a .py script.  This python script performs:  
      - Merge of the proteomics and metabolomics datasets
      - Data cleaning
      - Missing data checks and removal of data based on criteria
      - Check for outliers
      - MCAR/MAR assumptions test
      - Summary statistics (section 5.4 of dissertation)
      - Imputation of missing data with KNN

- **Descriptive statistics**
    - Script for summary and descriptive statistics done (section 5.4). This is included in notebook: Data_pre_process_and_statsanalysis.ipynb (in **Data_pre_process_and_descriptive_stats folder**)
 
- **Machine learning as a classification task**
    - First experiment set (section 5.4.1.3.1): Name of folder: 1st_set_experiments  
      * Three sub-folders with the python scripts of the classifiers explored: SVMs, Random Forest and XGBoost
    - Second experiment set (section 5.4.1.3.2): Name of folder: 2nd_set_experiments  
      * Three sub-folders with the python scripts of the experiments run per dementia prediction threshold (Dementia_overall; 5 to 10 years prediction; over 10 years prediction)
    - Third experiment set (section 5.4.1.3.3): Name of folder: 3rd_set_experiments   
      * includes python script for the refit with normalised GFAP and NEFL variables
    - Fourth experiment set (section 5.4.1.3.4): Name of folder: 4th_set_experiments
      * includes python scrupt for fourth experiment: speech in noise variable
 
- **Survival machine learning**
    -  Code as per described in section 5.4.2. Name of folder: Survival_Machine_Learning
      
 - **Summary of results**  
      Python code for the summary of the results for the first and second round of experiments (section 6.2.1 and 6.2.2).  
    - Name of folder: Summary_results  
    - Name of files: Summary_results.ipynb (there is also a .py version of the same script)
