# Code used in the dissertation
### Background
Dementia is a serious global health challenge. This research aims to identify cost-effective, non-invasive dementia risk signatures, such as blood-based biomarkers for dementia risk prediction. To the best of the authorâ€™s knowledge, this is the first study to integrate proteomics, metabolomics, genetic markers, and baseline clinical variables for individualised dementia risk prediction in the preclinical stage. Results from this work will determine whether blood-based biomarkers and machine learning can predict future dementia risk at an individual level.
